# Simple To Do List with Contexts

This project is a simples To Do List with a context for each added task. The "context tag" is the context in whitch you need to be to execute the task. For this project I used four contexts: Home, Work, Shopping and Computer. 

Its made using **Laravel 8.X** and **Bootstrap 4.1**.

In this project we cand create, read, update and remove __(CRUD)__ selected tasks. For removing it uses softDeletes.

We also can filter tasks using the contexts, wich are four (Home, Work, Shopping and Computer), selected by me. 

For the database configuration I used the __/config/database.php__ file, not the __.ENV__ file.
