# Simple To Do List with Contexts

This project is a simples To Do List with a context for each added task. 

Its made using Laravel 8.X and Bootstrap 4.1.

In this project we cand create, read, update and remove (CRUD) selected tasks. For removing it uses softDeletes.

We also can filter tasks using the contexts, wich are four (Home, Work, Shopping and Computer), selected by me.
